 This is a basic problem involving some file reading and writing. You can put what you have learnt in earlier units
 to use here - functions or nested functions, lists, sorting, generators(optional), comprehensions (optional) etc.

1. Review the relevant lessons if you are blocked.
2. Do not modify the given input files :), modify your code to handle them.
3. Write helper routines where as needed.
4. You can write your own test routines like test_sort_words2(), but comment them out before submitting.
5. Review the files lesson and write elegant code. Python api/features makes it possible to write concise and efficient code.
